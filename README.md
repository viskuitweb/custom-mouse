# custom-mouse

The goal is to make a custom pointer with CSS and JS

## How it works

div that follows the mouse every time it moves. When the cursor leaves the screen the cursor's div becomes 0x0px, so it seems like it desapears.


Shout out to Samson Omojola for the idea: https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-custom-mouse-cursor-css/
